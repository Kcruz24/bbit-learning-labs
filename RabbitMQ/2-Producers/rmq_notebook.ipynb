    "### What is Rabbit MQ?\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO Add high level description of Rabbit MQ & reference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Producing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In queuing we have two main sides, producers & consumers. You can various permutation(TODO find right word for multiplex) of relationships between producers & consumer(I.E 1 Producer to 1 consumer or 1 Producer to N Consumers). Within RMQ producers generate messages which can be any generic data that can be seralized & deserilized by consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data is created a producer can choose what queue to place the data on. This is done using a routing key within RabbitMQ. At a high level this routing key tells the rabbitMQ framework that the producer would like to send this message to queues that match a given regex string. As a more concrete example I may have a message intented for a particular set of schools that are all in the US. My routing key in that senario would be \"US\" which would signal this particular message should go to queues designated as US.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create a class that is setup to be a producer in the rabbitMQ framework. This class should publish a simple UTF-8 string message with some sort of unique identify (time, counter, etc). This class should loop sending messages until the program recieves an exit signal. The class should be able to take a delay interval which signal how long we should wait before send the next message. The class should also take the routing key to be used on construction \n",
    "\n",
    "- Allow for RMQ routing key to be passed in during class construction\n",
    "- Allow for publishing delay to be passed in during class construction\n",
    "- Publish generic message with some form of unique indentifier for each message\n",
    "- *Bounus* Allow for function pointer for message generation which is used by publishing class\n",
